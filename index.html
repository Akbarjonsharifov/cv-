  <p>So speaking in general.I'm in the beginning of my career, I have done many jobs which are irreelevant to tech,
    but my most valuable and beneficial job was being a receptionist so far. First of all, I've got a discount to all over the world,
  <br>which was part of ihg. Apart from that, social part was really good, communicating with different types of people during the shift was really interesting.</br></p>
